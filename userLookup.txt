Problem statement:
The user should be able to see if the username has been taken as he types in the username

Solution:

Approach - 1 : Using Merkle tree (As explained during the interview)

Merkle tree stores the hashes at every level. 
Once a tree is formed you can always fetch the hash corresponding to every level without knowing the hashes below that level. 
This is because once the tree is formed, all the hashes at various levels are stored and available. 
Even a slightest change in any data point will change its respective hash and hence the root hash will also be changed. 
Thus the root hash acts as a fingerprint of all the data points.

Approach -2 : Using Hash Table

We can map the usernames to a hash function and store them in a hashTable.
As the user types in the username, we do a quick lookup in the hashTable.
The time complexity of the lookup in the hashTable will be O(1) - constantTime
